# Simple-Linear-Regression
Simple linear regression is used to find out the best relationship between a single input variable (predictor, independent variable, input feature, input parameter) & output variable (predicted, dependent variable, output feature, output parameter) provided that both variables are continuous in nature. This relationship represents how an input variable is related to the output variable and how it is represented by a straight line.

With simple linear regression when we have a single input, we can use statistics to estimate the coefficients. This requires that you calculate statistical properties from the data such as means, standard deviations, correlations and covariance. All of the data must be available to traverse and calculate statistics.
